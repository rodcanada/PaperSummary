## A User Interface for Interactive Cinematic Shadow Design

Authors: Fabio Pellacini, Parag Tole and  Donald P. Greenberg 

#### Abstract
Placing shadows is difficult task since shadows depend on the
relative positions of lights and objects in an unintuitive manner.
To simplify the task of the modeler, we present a user interface
for designing shadows in 3d environments. In our interface,
shadows are treated as first-class modeling primitives just like
objects and lights. To transform a shadow, the user can simply
move, rescale or rotate the shadow as if it was a 2d object on the
scene√≠s surfaces.

When the user transforms a shadow, the system moves lights or
objects in the scene as required and updates the shadows in
realtime during mouse movement. To facilitate interaction, the
user can also specify constraints that the shadows must obey, such
as never casting a shadow on the face of a character. These
constraints are then verified in real-time, limiting mouse
movement when necessary. We also integrate in our interface fake
shadows typically used in computer animation. This allows the
user to draw shadowed and non-shadowed regions directly on
surfaces in the scene. 

#### Summary
This paper proposed an interactive user interface for maniupalating the shadows.
It threats shadow as first-class object like light and model in the scene.

Pros:
Fast: performance in real time
Intuitive: directly desgin the shadow
Shadow cookie is also supported

Cons:
I think it can only deal with one model each time.
